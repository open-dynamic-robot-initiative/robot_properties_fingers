Models of the (Tri-)Finger Robots
=================================

This package contains XACRO and mesh files for the various Finger and TriFinger
robots as well as some Python utils to work with the models.

For each finger type there is a model for a single finger and one for the
TriFinger which simply consists of three times the single finger.
